    Please propose a funky simple software project that will take under <%= rand(3..12) %> hours to complete in 1 quick sentence.
    Don't do hardware projects, only software.
    Keep it at less than 15 words.
    The funkier, stupidier, and sillier your ideas the better, but they should still make sense.
    Think out of the box, and do not propose ideas that do nothing but generate text, like a joke or dance move generator.
    Random sound effect generators are boring, do not suggest them.
    Be very creative, do not suggest projects that are too simple.
    Don't suggest anything too offensive or inappropriate such as slurs.
    Do not under any circumstances mention 'whimsical'.
    Your response must start with "<%= t "message_starters" %>".
    While you should be creative, don't just generate complete nonsense– think of what the project would actually be before throwing together words.
    <% if rand > 0.1 %>
      Avoid using these concepts in your idea: (<%= t("banned_things")["array"].join(", ") %>).
    <% end %>
    <% if rand > 0.8 %>
      Additionally, here are a handful of random things you can choose to include. Only include them if they are relevant to the project idea: <%= @random_things %>.
    <% end %>
  formatting: >
    You are helping me mark up a video game character's dialogue script.
    Do not edit the actual words, but use the following tools listed.
    Tools are delimited by pipe characters (|).
    For example, "Oooooh, if it isn't my favorite customer!" could be marked up as "icon:cute|speed:slow|oh.o.o.o.o|pause:350|icon:info|if it isn't|icon:smile| my favorite customer!"
    The speed tool changes the rate of speech and pitch "speed:slow", "speed:fast", "speed:default".
    The icon tool changes the character's face or animation. You can only use the following icons (for example, "|icon:cute|")
    - freaking (surprised / freaking out)
    - threat (looking angry, threatening)
    - reading (with glasses, reading a book)
    - reading2 (alternative reading expression)
    - question (looking confused)
    - question2
    - cute (cute, with fingers in a 👉👈 expression)
    - ded (playing dead)
    - info (an informative look)
    - peefest (crying with a thumbs up- used for irony or blursed things)
    - not_amused (looking annoyed)
    - fluster (blushing, embarassed)
    The timing tool is a markup for pauses in speech. For example "pause:1000" adds a 1 second pause. Pauses can only be 1 second at most and should be used sparingly to prevent speech from taking too long.
    Lastly, dots can be used for elongated sounds. For example, "oh.o.o.o.o" indicates the word "oh" should be drawn out. This does not need a pipe character.
    Keep in mind, tools get called exactly where they show in the text– for example, if you put |icon:cute| in the middle of a sentence, it will only be applied at that point going forward (reading left to right). Putting an icon at the very end of the sentence will not apply it to any words.
    Keep your text natural- for example "icon:think|Hmmm,|icon:question|i wonder how this tastes?" is more natural than "icon:think|Hmmm,i wonder how this tastes?|icon:question".
    Calling without a tool call is invalid and will create a broken response. You can't do something like "hello|question|world", it needs to be "hello|icon:question|world".
    Don't miss indentation or spacing. "hello world" => "hello|icon:info| world"

    Here is the dialogue to format. Reply with the formatted response only, no explaination or other yapping: <%= @text %>
