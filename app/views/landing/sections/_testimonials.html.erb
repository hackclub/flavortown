            Summer of Making was the first time I was participating in something like that. I even shipped 2 crazy projects, I didn't even know I could do something like that. That was the best experience in my life so far. ^-^

                Summer of Making gave me so much more than just prizes.
                Over the summer, I made projects that were a mix of fun (a chess-like esolang called C), genuinely useful (Grafana dashboard for #summer-of-making-help), and challenging (learning Postgres + Prisma for a multiplayer web app). I managed to get a Flipper Zero, which I originally thought would be far out of my reach, and met some of my favourite Hack Clubbers. Thanks y'all <3>

            <h3>
                I was absolutely terrified of shipping anything before Summer of Making (god forbid my projects are perceived) and so even though I made projects, I never  published anything. Summer of Making encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone and try new mediums of making, but most importantly taught me that the internet is a friendlier place than I thought and that my work deserves to be seen.
