      <h2>A project by Hack Club</h2>
      <p>Hack Club is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and network of 60k+ technical high schoolers. We believe you learn best by building so we're creating community and providing grants so you can make awesome projects. In the past few years, we've partnered with GitHub to run Summer of Making, hosted the world's longest hackathon on land, and ran Canada's largest high school hackathon.</p>
      <p>At Hack Club, students aren't just learning, they're shipping.</p>
